    "description": "Steve Carell (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) stars in this sitcom based on Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant's award-winning comedy. Told through the lenses of a documentary film crew, The Office exposes the humorous and often foolish events at Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. <br><br> In this first season, Dunder-Mifflin Regional Manager, Michael Scott (Carell) leads the documentary team and his staff on a journey through inappropriate behavior, well-intentioned but misguided comments and a myriad of poor management techniques. Michael has no clue that his employees can barely tolerate him. In his mind, he is their guru, their mentor, and their cool friend. His staff includes his dedicated-to-the-point-of-annoying assistant, Dwight Schrute, office receptionist Pam, and likable sales rep Jim. During the six episodes of Season 1, Dunder-Mifflin tackles tough subjects including company layoffs, diversity initiatives, health care, and office alliances. Anyone who has ever worked in a \"team\" environment can appreciate the humor and suffering of the Dunder-Mifflin staff and <i>The Office</i>.",

Making a characteristically bad leadership decision, Michael decides not to tell his staff, but the information quickly leaks.
